# Light integration

> In the simplest case, send your users to your partner quote page URL. It will look something like this

```shell
"https://ncp-123456.novicap.com/quote?quote_key=abcd"
```

We offer a lightweight integration for partners in the form of a customizable free quote page. The URL can be generated by logging into your partner account at [novicap.com](https://www.novicap.com) (Settings -> Free quote page).

Users should be redirected to the given URL.

In the simplest case, they will be asked to input their information manually before receiving a quote. You can provide the following information as additional parameters in the URL to skip these steps. If you provide all the information below, the user will see a quote without any manual input. If you also set the "direct_integration" param to "true", the user will be automatically logged in and redirected to their account page.


> If you are uncomfortable sharing the contact information in plaintext then you can base64 encode the contact details:

```shell
https://ncp-372814.novicap.com/quote?api_key=9dedd03c7e43072f52dd99439e04430a&company_novicap_id=ESB50460609&debtor_novicap_id=ESA08002883&details=eyJmaXJzdF9uYW1lIjoiTWFyYyIsImxhc3RfbmFtZSI6IkFudG9uaSBNYWNp\nYSIsInBob25lIjoiNzIyNzA4MDUzIiwiZW1haWwiOiJtYXJjQG5vdmljYXAu\nY29tIn0=

json hash:
{
  "first_name":"John",
  "last_name":"Snow",
  "phone":"724565898",
  "email":"snow@novicap.com"
}

json hash encoded in base64:
