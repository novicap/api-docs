# Light integration

> In the simplest case, send your users to your partner quote page URL. It will look something like this

```shell
"https://ncp-123456.novicap.com/quote?quote_key=abcd"
```

We offer a lightweight integration for partners in the form of a customizable free quote page. The URL can be generated by logging into your partner account at [novicap.com](https://www.novicap.com) (Settings -> Free quote page).

Users should be redirected to the given URL.

In the simplest case, they will be asked to input their information manually before receiving a quote. You can provide the following information as additional parameters in the URL to skip these steps. If you provide all the information below, the user will see a quote without any manual input. If you also set the "direct_integration" param to "true", the user will be automatically logged in and redirected to her application page.

If you are uncomfortable sharing the contact information in plaintext then you can base64 encode the contact details:
