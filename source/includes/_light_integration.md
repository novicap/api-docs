# Light integration

> In the simplest case, send your users to your partner quote page URL. It will look something like this

```shell
"https://ncp-123456.novicap.com/quote?key=abcd"
```

We offer a lightweight integration for partners in the form of a customiseable free quote page. The URL can be generated by logging into your partner account at [novicap.com](https://www.novicap.com) (Settings -> Free quote page).

Users should be redirected to the given URL.

In the simplest case, they will be asked to input their information manually before receiving a quote. You can provide the following information as additional parameters in the URL to skip these steps. If you provide all the information below, the user will see a quote without any manual input.

## Parameters

> A URL with all parameters filled in would look something like this

```shell
"https://ncp-123456.novicap.com/quote?key=abcd \
                                     &company_novicap_id=GB123456 \
